@description
Use JavaScript to dynamically calculate fields that are normally static.  This allows for events
that automatically change based on the game's state.  For example, an npc event's graphic field can
be computed based on whether a "food" event is in the room.  If the player removes the "food" event,
then the npc event's graphic automatically changes.

This plugin is useful if the game has many state changes and/or many events reacting to state changes.

The plugin field "computed-fields" lets you specify which fields can be computed.  See comments for
this field at the bottom of this header.


HOW TO USE - COMPUTE AVATAR'S GRAPHIC BASED ON WHICH SIDE OF THE ROOM THEY ARE ON
1. Import this plugin into a game with an open room to move about in.
2. Create two tiles for two avatar graphics.
3. Create two tile fields on the Avatar event.  Name them "graphic-1" and "graphic-2".  Set them to the tiles of step 2.
4. Change the avatar event's "graphic" field to be "javascript" type.  Set it to this code:
  let f = "graphic-1";
  if (EVENT.position[0] > 7) f = "graphic-2";
  let data = FIELD(EVENT, f, "tile");
  return { type: "tile", data: data };
5. Run the game and move the player horizontally across the room.  Note that it's graphic changes halfway across.
6. BONUS: Note that the avatar shows no graphic in the editor.  You can fix this by adding a "tile"
     type field named "graphic" anywhere below the field of step 4.  The editor will use this
     field for the graphic, while the playback will use the field of step 4 for the graphic.


HOW TO USE - COMPUTE TERRAIN PASSABILITY BASED ON WHETHER AN ITEM IS TAKEN
1. Import this plugin into a game with an open room to move about in.
2. Draw a "key" tile for an item.
3. Draw a "fence" tile.
4. Draw a "door" tile for an interactible.
5. Add a "message" event beside the avatar event.  Add a tile field named "graphic" and set it to
     the tile of step 2.  Add a tag field named "key".  Set the "say" field to "I've got the key".
6. Draw fence on the map (from the tile of step 3) that surrounds the avatar and key.  Leave one tile open for a door.
7. Draw walls on the fence map cells to make them unpassable.
8. Add a "character" event on the opening of the fence.  Set its graphic to the door tile of step 4.  Erase the "say" field.
9. Change the "solid" tag field for the event of step 8 to javascript type.  Set it to this code:
  if (FIND_EVENT("key")) {
    return { type: "tag", data: true };
  }
8. Playtest the game.  Try to step through the door without getting the key.  You should be blocked.  Walk over the key and now the door should not block you.
