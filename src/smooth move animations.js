@description
Builds on the smooth-move plugin to let you define unique walking and idle tiles in each direction
for any event.  Useful if using bipsi for a more graphically involved game.

NOTE - This plugin requires the smooth-move plugin in order to work.  It also needs to come AFTER
smooth-move, so set it's "plugin-order" to something higher than what the smooth-move plugin's
plugin-order is set to.

This works by letting you define extra tile type fields for different movement states of an event.
None of the extra tile fields are required.  Any missing fields are replaced with logical defaults.
All direction tiles default to the generic "graphic-idle" and "graphic-move" tiles.  Meanwhile, the
"graphic-idle" and "graphic-move" tiles default to the base "graphic" tile.  And if the event has
no "graphic" tile field then the event just won't be visible, as normal.


Here is the full list of the tile fields smooth-move-animations can use:

SMOOTH-MOVE-ANIMATIONS TILE FIELD KEYS:
graphic-idle, graphic-move,
graphic-idle-left, graphic-idle-right, graphic-idle-up, graphic-idle-down,
graphic-move-left, graphic-move-right, graphic-move-up, graphic-move-down

HOW TO USE - BASIC:
1. Import the smooth-move plugin into your game (required).
2. Import this plugin into your game.  Set it's "plugin-order" field to 1.
3. Create a tile to represent your avatar standing still.
4. Create a tile to represent your avatar moving.
5. Add a tile field to your avatar and name it "graphic-idle".  Set the field to the tile of step 3.
6. Add a tile field to your avatar and name it "graphic-move".  Set the field to the tile of step 4.
7. Playtest the game and move the avatar about.  Note that the avatar switches between the tiles
   when moving vs not moving.


HOW TO USE - ADVANCED:
1. Import the smooth-move plugin into your game (required).
2. Import this plugin into your game.  Set it's "plugin-order" field to 1.
3. Create tiles to represent your avatar standing still in all four directions: up, down, left, right.
4. Create tiles to represent your avatar moving in all four directions: up, down, left, right.
5. Add a four tile fields to your avatar and name them "graphic-idle-up", "graphic-idle-down",
   "graphic-idle-left", "graphic-idle-right".  Set each field to the proper tiles of step 3.
6. Add a four tile fields to your avatar and name them "graphic-move-up", "graphic-move-down",
   "graphic-move-left", "graphic-move-right".  Set each field to the proper tiles of step 4.
7. Playtest the game and move the avatar about.  Note that the avatar switches logically between all
   8 tiles.
